**Project Description**
Picturesque is a Photo Gallery application showcasing a collection of my favourite pictures built using Pytho - Django.

Users get to view photos uploaded by admin.
Users can see photos based on the location, by clicking on the listed locations in the menu.
They can also copy the link to a photo to paste at their discretion.
Users can search for photos based on categories.
